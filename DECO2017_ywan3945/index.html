                  The film ONE AND ONLY shines a spotlight on the journey of a 
                  nobody in pursuit of his dreams. Chen Shuo, a passionate 
                  teenager, shoulders the burden of his family, but never gives 
                  up on the pursuit of his dream. He runs back and forth between 
                  life and passion, trying to balance between faith and reality, 
                  and writing a hymn to his youth with his own determined will. 
                  The film also tells the audience a story of inter-generational 
                  inheritance: when Ding Lei, a veteran street dancer, meets Chen 
                  Shuo, a young street dancer, Ding Lei's words "keep working hard 
                  and you will succeed" rekindle the youngster's faith; and Chen 
                  Shuo's perseverance and hard work have also restored the initial 
                  aspiration of this disillusioned street dance veteran. The 
                  mentoring friendship and the reborn soul of the group bring 
                  unparalleled strength to the teenager, who leads the members of 
                  the group with his enthusiasm and fearlessness, to compose 
                  together a passionate melody of summer with their youth.

                  Lao Luo is a prolific stuntman who works with his Red Hare, his 
                  deformed-at-birth stunt horse who he saved from euthanasia. 
                  His life is falling apart - he had suffered a serious injury 
                  that sent him bankrupt 8 years ago and lost the custody of his 
                  daughter, Xiao Bao, after divorcing his late wife while she was 
                  still young. One night, Lao and Red Hare get into a fight with 
                  debt collectors and they soon learn Red Hare is at risk of being 
                  auctioned after their original company went bankrupt. Lao seeks 
                  legal help from Bao, now a university student studying law, and 
                  despite being reluctant at first, she offers him the services of 
                  her boyfriend, Naihua.
                  Meanwhile, after Lao's fight with the debt collectors goes viral, 
                  he and Red Hare are hired for several films, with Bao becoming his 
                  agent ad litem. Although they are able to help each other during 
                  tough situations, Bao soon expresses discomfort at Lao's stunt work, 
                  fearing that he and Red Hare might suffer dangerous injuries. After 
                  Lao embarrasses Bao in front of Naihua's parents, she leaves him in 
                  disgust. Afterwards, Lao and Red Hare get seriously injured during a 
                  stunt and as a result, Lao is sent to the hospital. While searching 
                  Lao's home for an ID card, Bao learns that he has saved CCTV footage 
                  of a failed meeting he had with her when she was younger. A touched 
                  Bao reconciles with Lao at the hospital, and Lao promises to stop 
                  doing stunt work.
                  On one night, Lao wakes up to witness the debt collectors trying 
                  to steal Red Hare; after a brief confrontation, he pays his debt 
                  and invites Dami Ge, the leading debt-collecting thug, to become 
                  one of his disciples. The next day, Yuanjie, Lao's apprentice, 
                  invites him for a role in his film which pays homage to stunt 
                  work - Lao accepts as a final job, to Bao's dismay. Whilst 
                  filming, Lao insists on performing a dangerous stunt himself, but 
                  is unable to finish it after remembering Bao's words and quits 
                  the job. Despite being able to reconcile with Bao once again, Lao 
                  loses Red Hare's case, and is forced to sell them to a company. 
                  Refusing to leave them torn apart, Bao and Naihua convince the 
                  company's CEO, He Xin, to return Red Hare and show him footage of 
                  Lao's previous stunt work to display his dedication to his work. 
                  He Xin returns Red Hare to Lao, explaining that he intended to 
                  return the horse already - Red Hare had attempted to starve 
                  himself while being owned by the company. He Xin leaves as Lao, 
                  Bao, and Naihua reunite with Red Hare.
